# Terraform Infrastructure Starter

A starter template for a the infrastructure layer within a Duplocloud portal. Each module represents a topological layer containing your individual resources defined as compnents. For example an infrastructure contains tenants topologically and we also provide a library of components to use in your own stack. 

This template is a high level implementation of the using the [Duplocloud Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/duplocloud/duplocloud/latest) and the [Duplocloud Terraform Components](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/duplocloud/components/duplocloud/latest). This is a much quicker and opinionated way to get going very fast with Duplocloud Terraform versus building your own modules from scratch using the provider. Now image what you have to do without Duplo. ðŸ˜‰
